The evolution of human-computer interaction has been marked by the widespread adoption of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), particularly in the form of touch screens on mobile devices. However, the integration of touch screen technology into larger displays, such as those found in laptops and desktops, remains a challenge due to cost considerations. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel solution: a virtual mouse system that leverages hand motions as a substitute for touch displays.
Our study focuses on the manipulation of cursor movement through live camera input, offering a departure from conventional methods that involve modifying physical components of the mouse. Instead, our approach involves a complete redesign of the hardware. We employ computer vision techniques, including picture segmentation and gesture recognition, to analyze hand motions captured by a webcam. Specifically, we utilize the hand landmarks provided by the MediaPipe library to track and interpret hand movements.
The displacement of these landmarks serves as stimuli for various mouse actions, including left-click, right-click, selection, screen capture, volume adjustment, and brightness control. By utilizing existing hand tracking capabilities and integrating them into a virtual mouse interface, we eliminate the need for additional hardware components and provide a cost-effective alternative to touch screen technology for desktop and laptop computers.
Our virtual mouse system represents a paradigm shift in computer interaction, offering users a seamless and intuitive means of navigating digital environments without the need for specialized hardware. This innovation opens up new possibilities for enhanced productivity, accessibility, and user experience in computing, paving the way for future advancements in human-computer interaction.
